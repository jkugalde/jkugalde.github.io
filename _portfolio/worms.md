This project had two parts. I work on it while doing my bachelor.

First, the proof of concept for a worm like soft robot that crawls in confined space, using a open loop time controlled algorithm. It produced a [conference article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311101877_Design_Fabrication_and_Control_of_a_Multi-Material-Multi-Actuator_Soft_Robot_Inspired_by_Burrowing_Worms).

Second, implementation of a closed loop control adding soft "tactile" sensors. This was my [thesis](https://repositorio.uchile.cl/handle/2250/146772) project for graduating from the bachelor, and also generated a [publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332063464_An_earthworm-inspired_soft_robot_with_perceptive_artificial_skin/citations?latestCitations=PB%3A384282374). [Here](https://github.com/jkugalde/SoftWorm) is some code and a link to a video.

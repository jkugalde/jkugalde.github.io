The objective of the project was to print an scaffold using a protein mixed with plastic pellet, as a proof of concept to generate a bio compatible tailored implant to promote osteogenesis. I modified a TUMaker pellet extruder and created an [script](https://github.com/jkugalde/G-Code-scaffold) to produce the required toolpaths.

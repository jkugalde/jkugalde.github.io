## Summary

I made an proof-of-concept extruder that prints using plastic pellets. I made this for a project with the pharmaceutics school, where PCL pellets mixed with certain protein were used to print scaffolds. These scaffolds were going to be implanted in rats to study bone regeneration.

I made the extruder, tune the printing parameters, and writed a program in OpenSCAD to generate the scaffolding.

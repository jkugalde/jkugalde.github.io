## Resume


I made a rotocaster using aluminium profiles, a car window motor, an Arduino and some other minor parts. It works really well, BUT, it has no heating elements, so it is not suitable for thermoplastics. The UI sucks, maybe you can make a better one c: It uses and Arduino multifunction shield.

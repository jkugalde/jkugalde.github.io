## Resume

I collaborated with the physics department to make an electroacustic levitator and study suspended particles. The chasis is 3d printed, it works with an Arduino to produce the waves and a H-Bridge as driver for the emitters.

It is a replication of [THIS](https://www.instructables.com/Acoustic-Levitator/) project.

## Summary

A colleague and i were hired to built a portable system to dispense paste through shears when pruning branches.

The paste is stored in a backpack, and is pushed out using a small persitaltic pump (made by us) activated by a button in the shear. This pump is in a box with the control system and a battery. The paste comes out through a metal piece attached to the shear.

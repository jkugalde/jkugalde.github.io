I made this with [Teresa Valdes](https://www.instagram.com/t.luz._/?hl=es), my girlfriend at that time. We printed three pieces from [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3713628) design, then glued, put some putty all over it, sanded, prime it, and finally painted it. It was a lot of effort but totally worth it.

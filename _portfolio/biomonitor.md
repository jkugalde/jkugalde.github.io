## Summary

The [ISCI](https://isci.cl/) made an electronic device to measure a variety of biological signals from the wrist of a person. I made a smartwatch like encapsulation for it, using 3d printed molds (to inject) and pieces. The first part of the project was to make 10 of these devices to get data from people in different situations while commuting. Here is a [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68wVg9pD4Sw&t=2s) with some explanation.

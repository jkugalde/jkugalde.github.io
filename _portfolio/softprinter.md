## Summary

The objective of the project was to print a soft sensor. We used two approaches for this: 1) A liquid in liquid printer that injects liquid metal in a silicone maxtrix 2) A 3d printed deformable and conductive path covered in silicone films.

For the first approach, I hacked a Makerbot with an Arduino/RAMPS combo and implementd a syringe pump.

For the second one, I designed a stretchable pattern and printed it using conductive PLA. Then, it was covered with silicone in a two step process.

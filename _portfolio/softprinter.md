I had to do this two times.

First time, the objective of the project was to print a soft sensor. I hacked a Makerbot with an Arduino/RAMPS combo and implementd a syringe pump. The syringe contained liquid metal and it was deposited in uncured silicone.

The second time, I had to make the same machine for a student that was dropping water inside a silicone matrix to generate a metamaterial. [Here](/files/liquidprint.pdf) is some info.

The machine was later used by another student to drop a ferromagnetic fluid into a silicone matrix.

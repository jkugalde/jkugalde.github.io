In the first phase of the [SBF project](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/sbf/) I made a proof-of-concept peristaltic pump to move glue, specifically PUR. It was 3d printed, except for the couple that joints the rotor and the motor shaft. It worked fine enough for the phase goal. I also made the tool for deposition, it was installed on a cartesian manipulator and drew the glue lines seen in the image below.

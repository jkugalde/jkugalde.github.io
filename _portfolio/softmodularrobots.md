## Summary

This was my main project working as R.A in the robotics lab in the department of mechanical engineering at the University of Chile. It was a continuation of this [investigation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312121627_Soft_Modular_Robotic_Cubes_Toward_Replicating_Morphogenetic_Movements_of_the_Embryo).

The goal was to study the actuated behavior of multiple structures built with inflatable cubes made of silicone. Some of them were attached with magnets as a part of their body and others just glued togheter. I performed the following activities:

- Develop a new design and fabrication process of modular soft cube, aiming to reduce fabrication time and increase quality.
- Simulate different assemblies and actuation algorithms, using VoxCad.
- Built a pneumatic control system.
- Write a program with Arduino to control the robots.
- Characterize the behaviour of the robots using a tracking device.

I obtained interesting results, but dropped the project as i accepted another job. The work remains unpublished.

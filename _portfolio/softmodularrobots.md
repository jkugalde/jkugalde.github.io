This was my main project working as R.A in the robotics lab in the department of mechanical engineering at the University of Chile. It was a continuation of this [investigation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312121627_Soft_Modular_Robotic_Cubes_Toward_Replicating_Morphogenetic_Movements_of_the_Embryo).

I obtained interesting results, but dropped the project as I moved to another job. The data and findings remain unpublished.

Two of the configurations, developing a crawling gait.

A few years later, I provided an actuation and control system for a similar project, using elastomeric metamaterials for a worm like modular robot. [Here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264127521008406) it is the publication.

# Summary

I made a lamp to work in my 3030 T-SLot table, this is the second version.

## Features

- Cheap
- Rotation at the base, two hinge joints and a spherical joint at the top.
- The cable goes inside the tubes.
- Base must be bolted to the table, with M5 bolts... or you can use screws.

## Asssembly guide

### Preparing parts

-Cut three pieces of the aluminium tube using a saw or tube cutter. They do not have to be necessarily the same size, 20 cm is ok for each piece.

### Step by step

- Put one piece of the aluminium tube inside the Base piece, and pass the wire through the back of it and into the tube until it comes out from the other side.
- Put a ConnectorA on top of the tube and pass the cables.
- Get another piece of aluminium tube an put a ConnectorB in it.
- Join the connectors with a M5x45 bolt, a washer in between the flat faces and with a lock nut on the other side.
- Pass the cable from the ConnectorA into the B and push them out of the second tube.
- Repeat the last two steps with the third aluminium piece.
- Pass the cable trough the BallConector and put it on top of the the aluminium tube.

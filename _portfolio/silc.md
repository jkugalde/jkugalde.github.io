## Summary

This device measures fracture energy in rock samples using a strain gauge. A steel ball is dropped and hits the sample, the deformation wave through a steel rod is sensed by the strain gauge. It is an upgrade from the original machine described in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45363104_A_portable_load_cell_for_in-situ_ore_impact_breakage_testing).

I am currently working in this project, the new features are:

- Suction cup mechanism to drop the ball instead of metal jaw.
- Laser measurement system, to automatically get sizes and distances, also acts as a trigger for the data logger.
- Lineaar actuator for ball positioning.

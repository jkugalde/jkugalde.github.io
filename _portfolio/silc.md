This device measures fracture energy in rock samples using a strain gauge. A steel ball is dropped and hits the sample, the deformation wave through a steel rod is sensed by the strain gauge. It is an upgrade from the original machine described in this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45363104_A_portable_load_cell_for_in-situ_ore_impact_breakage_testing).

This machine uses stepper motors and a laser to set precisely the distance of the impact ball from the sample. The ball is held using a suction cup.

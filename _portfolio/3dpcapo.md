## Summary

I love playing guitar, but i do not like capos, until i found the spanish design. As a maker, i obviously tried to make one.

It is 3d printed in wood-like filament, then sanded and painted. IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE WOOD, i am very satisfied with it.

I made a video about the making, but youtube censored the music. In my IG account the video is splitted in three parts and has music, here is the [link](https://www.instagram.com/jotaka.ug/?hl=es).

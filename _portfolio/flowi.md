## Summary

The [emergency mechanical ventilator](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/bambu/) needs to measure air flow to the patient, we were using a commercial sensor but it was expensive and scarce, so we had to improvise a printable one.

This device measures pressure in two points, before and after an obstruction. The pressure drop can be related to flow using fluid mechanics equations. The obstacle is a thin sheet of plastic with a flexible geometry. The body of the instrument was printed using a sterilizable resin to be reusable, it also has stainless bolts.

We did not finish testing this prototype as the mechanical ventilator project ended, but it was showing promising results.

## Summary

Two persons are needed to make the [Biomonitor wristband](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/biomonitor/), due to some design flaws of the mold. For this reason, i redesigned the mold and also designed a machine to simplify the injection process. 

The mold is bolted in the frame of the machine and the resin filled syringe is placed in the linear actuator. After pressing a button, the plunge moves until the carriage hits a movable endstop. In this way, the process should be cleaner, effortless and doable by one person.

I still have to make it!

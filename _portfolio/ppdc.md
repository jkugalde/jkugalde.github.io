# Resume

My take on making a small peristaltic pump, using 3d printed parts and a DC motor. It has been tested successfully with glycerine, and controlled in an open and closed loop system, which are included in [THIS](https://github.com/jkugalde/3DP-Peristaltic-pump-DC) repository.

## Features

- Flow ? cc/s.
- 6 mm silicone hose.
- 12 V DC gearbox motor.

## Asssembly guide

### Step by step

- Press fit the M5 low profile nuts in the bottom of the Impulsor.
- Bolt a pair of bearings in each nut with the M5x15 bolts.
- Press M3 nuts in the cavities of the Impulsor.
- Put the set screws in the nuts, without passing to the center hole of the piece.
- Bolt the motor to the Tapa Inferior with the countersink bolts.
- Put a M4 washer in the motor axis.
- Pass the hose through the smaller hole of the CajaBomba first, and then out of the CajaBomba by the bigger hole.
- Put the Caja Bomba on top of the Tapa inferior.
- Put the impulsor in the axis, turning it to acommodate ith the hose.
- Tighten the set screws with the smaller allen wrench through the cavity in the hose side of the pump.
- Press some M5 nuts in the Tapa inferior.
- Bolt the TapaSuperior on top of the CajaBomba.

# Electronics

The usual way of using a DC motor is with an H-bridge and a controller like Arduino., as the figure below shows:

## Control

The system can be operated in a open or closed loop. 

### Open loop

For an open loop control you need the previous circuit and do some tests that relates the input of the motor with the flow, and then build a regression and/or use some timer.

### Closed loop

For a more precise operation it is possible to use a [load cell](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-Scale-With-5kg-Load-Cell-and-HX711-Amplifi/) to get feedback about the dispensed mass, as the next diagram shows:

<img src="/images/elec2.png" width="600">

To use the load cell, it is necessary to download the HX711 library for Arudino. The included sketch uses a 1kg load cell and a proportional controller. It requires the input of desired ml and translates it to mass (gr) using the specific volume of the substance.

## Components

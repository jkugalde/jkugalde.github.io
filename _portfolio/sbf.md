## Summary

A team of engineers and I developed an automated fabrication line for [Strong by Form](https://strongbyform.com/). The goal was to obtain a wooden board made with orientated chips. This board will then be molded using vacuum and heat in another machine, to produce a geometry that optimizes resistance considering the chip orientation, like the one shown in the image below:

To achieve this, we generated the following mechanical subsystems:

- Plank elevator.
- Plank slicer.
- Chip cutter.
- Robot arm manipulator (small).
- Robot arm manipulator (big).
- Glue pump.

We also installed sensors and programmed the system.

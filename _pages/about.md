Hi, my name is Joakin Ugalde, a chilean mechanical engineer interested in digital fabrication, automation and robotics in general. I'm currently working at the [Fablab U de Chile](http://www.fablab.uchile.cl/), a Fablab located in the faculty of engineering at the Universidad de Chile. You can read my CV [here](https://jkugalde.github.io/files/cv_2020.pdf).

My thesis was a bio inspired soft robot with soft sensors, you can get more info in [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332063464_An_earthworm-inspired_soft_robot_with_perceptive_artificial_skin) and watch a short video
in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2wraRIhEo).

Iâ€™m one of the founders of the Robotics community at the engineering faculty, where we created fun robotics iniciatives to get the students interested and involved in robotics, such as [Duckietown Chile](http://duckietown.cl/) and [Beauchef Robotics Challenge](https://www.instagram.com/beauchefrc/).

I like to teach and invent machines. You can check some of my drawings at my [site](https://grabcad.com/joakin.ugalde-1) in GrabCad, or some projects that i have developed in my github page.

I also enjoy cycling, playing guitar and solving my domestic problems with digital fabrication, i have some of the designs in [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/JKUgalde/designs) and sometimes i post photos in my Instagram account.

Hi, my name is Joakin Ugalde, a chilean mechanical engineer interested in digital fabrication, automation and robotics. I'm currently working at the [Fablab U de Chile](http://www.fablab.uchile.cl/), located in the Engineering School at the University of Chile where I also teach some engineering courses. I was accepted in the Laurea Magistrale in Mechanical Engineering program at Politecnico di Milano, which I plan to start on the fall of 2024. My CV is [here](https://jkugalde.github.io/files/JUgalde_2024.pdf)

My thesis was a bio inspired soft robot with soft sensors, you can get more info in [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332063464_An_earthworm-inspired_soft_robot_with_perceptive_artificial_skin) and watch a short video
in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2wraRIhEo).

I’m one of the founders of the Robotics community at the Universidad de Chile, where we created fun initiatives to interest and involve students in the field of robotics, such as [Duckietown Chile](http://duckietown.cl/) and [Beauchef Robotics Challenge](https://www.b-rc.cl).

I like to teach create machines and devices. You can check some of my drawings at my [site](https://grabcad.com/joakin.ugalde-1) in GrabCad, or some projects that I have developed in my github page.

I also enjoy cycling, playing guitar, taking photos, and solving my domestic problems with digital fabrication, I have some of the designs in [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/JKUgalde/designs) and sometimes post photos in my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jotaka.ug) account. Some of my photos are also on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/joakinugalde). Sometimes I make guitar tabs for songs or make my own guitar arrangements to play solo, they are on [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/u/jcugaldecas), in Cifra Club and in my Youtube channel.

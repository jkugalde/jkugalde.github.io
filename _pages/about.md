Hi, my name is Joakin Ugalde, a chilean mechanical engineer interested in digital fabrication, automation and robotics. Knowing how things work and how to make them is what has been leading my career development (and part of my hobbies), that is why I'm currently studying a master of science in mechanical engineering at University of Chile.

I spent most of my professional life working at the same university in different roles, such as research assistant, fablab staff, project developer, lecturer.

My thesis was a bio inspired soft robot with soft sensors, you can get more info in [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332063464_An_earthworm-inspired_soft_robot_with_perceptive_artificial_skin) and watch a short video
in [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ2wraRIhEo).

I’m one of the founders of the Robotics community at the Universidad de Chile, where we created fun initiatives to interest and involve students in the field of robotics, such as [Duckietown Chile](http://duckietown.cl/) and [Beauchef Robotics Challenge](https://www.b-rc.cl).

I enjoy creating machines and devices. You can check some of my drawings at my [site](https://grabcad.com/joakin.ugalde-1) in GrabCad, or some projects that I have developed in my github page.

I also enjoy cycling, playing guitar, taking photos, and solving my domestic problems with digital fabrication, I have some of the designs in [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/JKUgalde/designs) and sometimes post photos in my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jotaka.ug) account. Some of my photos are also on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/joakinugalde). Sometimes I make guitar tabs for songs or make my own guitar arrangements to play solo, they are on [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/u/jcugaldecas), in Cifra Club and in my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmIDZGeT_ZI) channel.

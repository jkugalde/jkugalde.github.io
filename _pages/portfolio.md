These are my main projects, in which i work from time to time after work. I have made some other stuff, but less fancy and more hardware focused, they are probably on my GrabCad page or in "Other projects" at the bottom of this page.

## N20 Robot Project

I made a 3d printed housing for a N20 type dc motor and joint it with an angle sensor (CJMCU-103). It controls shaft position using a PID control. [Link](https://github.com/jkugalde/N20-Servo-Module) to the github repository.

Then, i added a torsion spring at the shaft and another sensor at the ouput to measure the deformation. With this, the actuator gains compliancy and torque sensing. This is not updated yet in the repository.

Using 2 of these N20 Servo modules i made a jumping robot. [Link](https://github.com/jkugalde/Jumping-robot) to the github repository.

Naturally, i had to make a tetrapod using 4 of these leg modules equiped with the latest N20 servo design. I present to you, [Pochitabot](https://github.com/jkugalde/Pochitabot)

Probably the name will change in the future, as if it is matter of publication, the name must reflect the main characteristics, like Cheap Compliant Modular Printed robot, or something like that. The price of this robot is currently below 150 dollars.

It does not knows how to walk yet, but it surely can crawl. Further studies are needed. Also a PCB.

## SCARA 3DP

Using some spare parts and the remains of my ANETA8 i made a small SCARA robot arm with an electromagnet as effector. [Link](https://github.com/jkugalde/SCARA-3DP) to the github repository. It needs a lot of characterization. Currently moves using G-Code instructions from the serial monitor.

## Soft robot worm

My thesis project, a worm-like soft robot with artificial skin. The worm developed a crawling gait inside cavities and had soft sensors acting as pressure and deformation sensors to control the algorithm. I am trying to documentate (and improve) this project after a long long time. [This](https://github.com/jkugalde/SoftWorm) is the current repository.

# Other projects

## T-Slot Workbench

A 3030 [T-Slot workbench](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/tslottable/), with some plywood and 3dp parts.

## 3DP Vise

A [3d printed vise](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/3dp-vise/), i use it on my workbench to press fit and hold pieces.

## 3DP Lamp

A [3d printed lamp](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/3dplamp/), i use it on my workbench.

## 3DP electroacoustic levitator

An [electroacustic levitator](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/levitator/) made in collaboration with the physics department of the Universidad de Chile.

## Rotocasting machine

[Rotocasting machine](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/rotocaster/) for resines. Made with aluminium profiles and Arduino. It uses belts as transmission.

## Anet A8 Upgrade

I [upgraded](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/aneta8upgrade/) my Anet A8 with an aluminium frame.

<img src="/images/isoanet.png" width="300">

## Video laringoscope

A 3d printed [laringoscope](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/laringoscope/), it uses a Wi-Fi camera.

## Persitaltic pump (Stepper)

A [3d printed peristaltic pump](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/ppstep/), uses a NEMA17 stepper motor.

<img src="/images/ppstep.png" width="300">

## Persitaltic pump (DC)

A [3d printed peristaltic pump](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/ppdc/), uses a DC motor and a load cell.

<img src="/images/ppdc.png" width="300">

## Powder dispenser

A [3d printed powder dispenser](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/powderdispenser/), uses a DC motor and a load cell.

<img src="/images/isopowder.png" width="300">

## Enclosed 3D printer

I made an [enclosed 3d printer](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/jkprinter/) with the classical combination Arduino MEGA + RAMPs and T-Slots.

## Paste extruder

A Marlin-ified Replicator 2, with a syringe extruder adaptation for [paste material](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/pastextruder/).

## Biomonitor

I made the encapsulation for a [wearable smart device](https://jkugalde.github.io/portfolio/biomonitor/) developed at the Universidad de Chile.

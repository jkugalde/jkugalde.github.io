These are my main projects, in which i work from time to time. I have made some other stuff, but less fancy and more hardware focused, they are probably on my GrabCad page.

## N20 Servo module

I made a 3d printed housing for a N20 type dc motor and joint it with an angle sensor (CJMCU-103). It controls shaft position using a PID control. [Link](https://github.com/jkugalde/N20-Servo-Module) to the github repository.

Using 2 N20 Servo modules i made a jumping robot. [Link](https://github.com/jkugalde/Jumping-robot) to the github repository.

## Quadruped

Using three N20 Servo modules per leg, i pretend to make a tetrapod using an attiny.

## SCARA 3DP

Using some spare parts and the remains of my ANETA8 i made a small SCARA robot arm with an electromagnet as effector. [Link](https://github.com/jkugalde/SCARA-3DP) to the github repository.

## Soft robot worm

My thesis project, a worm-like soft robot with artificial skin. The worm developed a crawling gait inside cavities and had soft sensors acting as pressure and deformation sensors to control the algorithm.

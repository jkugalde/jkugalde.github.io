## [An earthworm-inspired soft robot with perceptive artificial skin](publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1)

A worm shaped soft robot mostly composed of silicone that crawls through cavities using a peristaltic gait and soft sensors, which help to control the anchoring to the inner walls of the cavities and the movement algorithm. The deformable body and perceptive skin allows the robot to move in uncharted an irregular ducts.

We designed a face shield based on the [<u>Prusa</u>](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc3) initiative. The idea of this design is reduce further work on the pieces, just print, buy the commercial parts and assemble. You can read more about it at the [<u>GitHub</u>](https://github.com/FabLabUChile/fabuchile-face-shield) site of the project. Also an [<u>article</u>](https://www.latercera.com/que-pasa/noticia/cientificos-chilenos-disenan-mascara-protectora-imprimible-en-3d-compostable-y-de-uso-abierto/F7MEVCYFVJALHKGSFPWE6PBHDQ/) from the local press.

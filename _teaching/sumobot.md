Workshop about Arduino, electronics and 3D Printing aimed at high school students. The objective was to develop a SumoBot, a small wheeled robot which competes against a pair, trying to push it off the arena.

The workshop was held once a week during two months in the Fablab U de Chile, the students were beneficiaries of a Foundation, and the workshop finished with an event at the San Crist√≥bal Hill in Downtown Santiago.

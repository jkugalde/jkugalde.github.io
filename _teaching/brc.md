We organized an open line follower robot tournament in the engineering faculty, the teams had to make their own robot, so we teach them how. The sessions were:

- 3D Drawing
- 3D Printing
- Arduino and electronics 101
- Designing a PCB
- PID Control 

Finally, the three first places went to the national tournament.
